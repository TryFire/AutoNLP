AutoNLP test
======================================


THE ORIGINAL VERSION IS FROM https://autodl.lri.fr/competitions/35#home

I have tried to submit, but in the website codalab of this challenge, the button ``upload a submission`` is dead, I have clicked for many times and changed laptop, it still didn't work. I will try it again after the vocation.

The best accuracy on the first dataset is expected to arrive to 81% (only evaluated locally on part of dataset splited from the whole dataset, in model-lstm.ipynb) which is competif to the best accuracy(79.8%), but the ALC is bad (test in local), the raison and solution is explained in the report).

## Contents
